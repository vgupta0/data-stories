## Fuzzy Techie Divide {.post-title}


One of the interesting questions that we can ask is about the fuzzy techie divide at Stanford. There have been a lot of recent articles (here's [one](https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=57728)) about the fact that fuzziness is being taken over by techniess. We can investigate this if we can come up with a way to describe what exactly is techie versus fuzzy.

The gut instinct solution is just to assign a number (negative for fuzzy, positive for techie) and then average over gender over time and see what's up, but I think that really doesn't help much since it's hard to know how techie some of the in between majors are (STS, HumBio/Psych, SymSys etc).

Majors are effectively made up of classes, so if we could somehow classify each class as being techie or fuzzy, we could then determine how techie/fuzzy the majors are and then average over the students. However, that requires a gut reaction for what the different classes' techie/fuzziness are.

So then how to solve that problem? Effectively, a class is made up of stuff you read and stuff you make/build/write (produce, in general, I guess). I'd be inclined to weight the stuff you product at at least a 3:1 ratio w.r.t. things you read since doing something teaches far more than reading about it. We could use the standard of avg hours of work for each assignment as a metric for how much each class does techie/fuzzy work.

Finally, it's hard to just think of the spectrum of techie and fuzzy. What does that mean, exactly? I think the acronym STEM can help break that down - the four major disciplies of techie are science, math, engineering, and technology. CS, for example, is pure tech and some math. Math is all math and some tech/science as a major. EE is evenly all of the above. MatSci is more science and engineering and less the other two etc etc. That's much easier to reason about than "techniness" or fuzziness. What might be harder is coming up with the appropriate opponent theory elements of humanities majors. What is the opposite of math? Art? Writing? Philosophy? It's hard to say... but I guess that's expected when you leave the techie world.

However, assuming we could come up with these 4 spectrums, the next question would be how to quantify them. I think that the best thing to do would be to use "hours of work" as a metric, then quantify each assignment in a class based on where it is in the scale (so hours = magnitude, and type = direction).

So in order to really do this calculation justice, I need data for the average hours spent on each assignment for each class at Stanford along with all the enrollment records for the majors (although I guess that could be approximated by looking at 4 year course plans).
