## Major Dominance {.post-title}

Well, the answer to this question in 2015 is CS.

And, in fact, many majors at Stanford (and especially the humanities) have become quite terrified of CS's perceived 'dominance' as a major - it's eating everything alive!

Now, there definitely is real reason for concern, which I'll explain in a little bit, but I think we can safely subtract the sensationalism. CS isn't the first major to undergo this sort of infamy over its popularity. 6 years ago, HumBio was in a similar position.

I think I see a lot of similarities here - just replace engineering now with biology related things back in the day - psychology etc. 

So to say that CS is taking over anything and it's a problem and act like it's never happened before is rather silly in my opinion. The fact is, it has happened in the past, as seen by the popularity of HumBio during the 2007 recession, and when everyone thought a health profession was one of the secure ones left. 

What does that suggest? I think (and this is seriously an opinion now) major dominance comes from the fact that there's a whole bunch of students who have a very slight or almost no inclination about what they want to pursue for a career when they come to college (and me included) - and all of them end up picking something along the lines of their interest but hedging their bet along the lines of prestige. In other words, there's plenty of smart people, and there's always "the thing" that smart people do. Right now it's CS and engineering, beause that field shows lots of promise for the future, and those who are undecided as to their future are taking up some position along that spectrum (SymSys, STS, MCS, PD, HCI etc). Also, CS isn't easy - it takes a fair amount of smarts and skills which leads to its financial worth which means doing CS fulfills the desire to do something challenging, but fulfilling and also support yourself. It's also a pretty universal skill set, so you can use the problem solving patterns no matter where you go.
