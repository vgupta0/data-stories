## Crayons {.post-title}

Another great set of colors from all of our childhoods is none other than crayons!

There are currently 120 official crayon colors. Let's take a look at what they are.

Here are all the colors plotted in LUV space. I think in real life, since they're pigments, they're proably darker, but a host of online sources confirmed these color codes, which all look like tints (meaning white has been mixed to a pure saturated color). In particular, the only saturated colors here are red, green, and the pink/violet/purple at the edges of the chart. Everything else is sort of subdued. The lightness values are all above 0.7 for the most part. It seems even crayola is a fan of having more warm colors than cool colors - there are a lot of peaches/tans/browns. At least in this capacity all the colors are the same.

Now that I have the pipline setup, it's really easy to just go ahead run the same grouping on the crayons.

Of course, with just 120 colors, there's not a lot of subdivision here, mostly just the major color groups that you would expect.

Between the two, I'd much rather use the original color set for the web, at least. Crayons are probably better with physical mediums :)
