    <p>Hi! My name is Vishesh Gupta and I'm a junior studying CS at Stanford.</p>
    <p>
      I started this blog to publish the stories I have exploring various small
      to medium size data sets and the interesting insights I've found. There's also
      a tab where I explain a lot of the algorithms I use for doing this analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two primary kinds of investigations I do are grouping/categorization
      and trendfinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any smallish data sets (fits in memory on a laptop) that
      you'd like me to take a look at, let me know!
