<h2 id="color-spaces" class="post-title">Color Spaces</h2>
<p>Color and it's definitions have a really interesting history - color opponent theory is the current prevailing scheme for how the brain interprets colors. There are innumerable color spaces, such as RGB (hex codes), HSB (hue saturation brightness), HSL (hue saturation lightness), HSV (hue saturation value) (and yes these three are different), CMYK (subtractive for print purposes), etc, etc.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to analyzing color, we have to use the &quot;real&quot; space defined by the CIE called CIELAB space. (there's also CIEL*A*b* CIELUV and CIELCh space, so it's not like they have anything well defined either.) LAB is Lightness, A which is supposed to model the magenta/red-green scale, and B, which models the presence or absence of short wavelengths (blue-yellow scale).</p>
<p>The left picture here has the space of CIELAB shown. Of course, we can't actually see all those colors on a computer because sRGB is a pitifully small gamut, so that's just an interpretation.</p>

<p>The picture on the right shows off a second color space, which is CIELUV. This space was invented to actually correct the perceptual problems in the CIELAB space (you can see that the blue region is expanded to make the chromaticity perception even across the space - indeed CIELUV is called the 'uniform chromaticity' space).</p>
<p>The eye's real response function is quite uneven and therefore hard to model with these sorts of diagrams. There's yet another set of spaces called CIELCh (for CIELAB) and CIELCHuv for CIELUV that represent the same spaces mapped to cylindrical coordinates (which some corrections, of course), which will become relevant in my discussions on color distance (how to tell how far apart two colors are).</p>
<p>The space itself is pretty good measure of color distance - you can take the [l a b] or [l u v] vector and do a regular euclidean norm and that's supposed to have even perception.</p>
