<h2 id="about-the-dataset">About the Dataset</h2>
<p>The story begins with Ingrid Sundberg, an author that came up with a color thesaurus. Color is an important thing to use in any kind of visual design, and a lot of interfaces need easy access to more colors than just red blue green etc.</p>
<p>So someone made a <a href="http://dudleystorey.github.io/thenewdefaults/">github project</a> and gave all these colors hex values and provided them free to use for everyone.</p>
<p>However, the grouping really bothered me. Let's consider the categories; we have (in order):</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; width:90%; height: 40px; display:flex; justify-content:space-around; text-align:center; vertical-align: center;">
<p><span style="flex:1; background-color: #fffefc;">White</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #0074d9;">Blue</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #e5dbac;">Tan</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #ffdc00;">Yellow</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #ff851b;">Orange</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #ff4136;">Red</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #f69acd;">Pink</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #b10dc9;">Purple</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #2ecc40;">Green</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #241709; color: #e5dbac;">Brown</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #aaaaaa;">Grey</span> <span style="flex:1; background-color: #111111; color: #aaaaaa">Black</span></p>
</div>
<p>So there are 4 &quot;neutral&quot; categories - white, black, tan and grey. The rest are colors of some form or another (I guess brown is on the fence, but I'm calling it a color). Of the remaning 8 categories, 6 are warm colors, and 2 are cold colors, which seems a little imbalanced. On top of that, the categories themselves are a little too simplistic. Each contains about 18-21 colors, but I'm not convinced all of them are really in the right location. For example, <span style="background-color:#757b87; padding: 0.25em 2px; text-align: center;"> slate </span> is put in the blue category, but I'm pretty sure it should go in the grey category. Pink and Purple aren't really categories in their own right - something like <span style="background-color:#fc4c4e; padding: 0.25em 2px; text-align: center;"> strawberry </span> really belongs in the red category, not the pink category, and <span style="background-color:#290916; color: white; padding: 0.25em 2px; text-align: center;"> raisin </span> really should go in the brown or black category.</p>
<p>So the two problems boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bad groupings of the already present colors</li>
<li>Imbalanced coverage of the color spectrum (few cold colors, lots of hot colors).</li>
</ul>
<p>My mission, should I accept it (and I did) is to make new groupings and fix the color imbalance - we need more greens and blues in this house.</p>
