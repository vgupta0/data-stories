<h2 id="crayons" class="post-title">Crayons</h2>
<p>Another great set of colors from all of our childhoods is none other than crayons!</p>
<p>There are currently 120 official crayon colors. Let's take a look at what they are.</p>

<p>Here are all the colors plotted in LUV space. I think in real life, since they're pigments, they're proably darker, but a host of online sources confirmed these color codes, which all look like tints (meaning white has been mixed to a pure saturated color). In particular, the only saturated colors here are red, green, and the pink/violet/purple at the edges of the chart. Everything else is sort of subdued. The lightness values are all above 0.7 for the most part. It seems even crayola is a fan of having more warm colors than cool colors - there are a lot of peaches/tans/browns. At least in this capacity all the colors are the same.</p>
<p>Now that I have the pipline setup, it's really easy to just go ahead run the same grouping on the crayons.</p>

<p>Of course, with just 120 colors, there's not a lot of subdivision here, mostly just the major color groups that you would expect.</p>
<p>Between the two, I'd much rather use the original color set for the web, at least. Crayons are probably better with physical mediums :)</p>
