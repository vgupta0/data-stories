<h2 id="axes-of-humanities" class="post-title">Axes Of Humanities</h2>
<p>I stated in the <a href="#/post/majors/tech-coefficients">previous post</a>, the analysis there was about the presence or absence of techniness in a major.</p>
<p>One could also try to create a scale that has a humanities end, so instead of just Science or no science, we could do Science-Art or Science-Writing or something.</p>
<p>Problem is, given the 4 axis of a technical major (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math), what are the corresponding axes of a humanities major?</p>
<p>There are more complications. Having 1 continuous axis means that there is mutual exclusivity between both ends. Essentially, you can either be sciency or be an art major. I'm not sure how accurate this is - consider data visualization, for example - lots of math and science, and lots of art to visualize (I suppose if you want to split hairs the analysis has math/science and the visualization is mostly art, but eh).</p>
<p>So it might be better to actually just have presence/absence for humanities as well as sciences, and then just sort of recover the idea of humanities/sciences from the presence or absence of certain very key fundamental parts of what it means to be a major in general.</p>
<p>How to do this? Well, stanford's ways framework might be able to help. The Stanford Ways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied Quantitative Reasoning (AQR)</li>
<li>Scientific Method and Analysis (SMA)</li>
<li>Formal Reasoning (FR)</li>
<li>Ethical Reasoning (ER)</li>
<li>Social Inquiry (SI)</li>
<li>Engaging Diversity (ED)</li>
<li>Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII)</li>
<li>Creative Expression (CE)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there are some issues. First, not all of the STEM coeffs are represented here - there are actually only three scientific things here, and they're conflations of STEM. AQR looks like engineering and SMA looks like Science, and FR looks like math or possibly CS. Personally all these words are more confusing for me than just calling it STEM and moving on from there. Also, the technology end of things is not covered here, and this framework is designed specifically to broadly categorize courses so as a student I have many options to fulfill any of these requirements.</p>
<p>I think though, on the humanities side we have ER,SI,ED,AII,CE and</p>
