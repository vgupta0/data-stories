<p>One of the interesting questions that we can ask is about the fuzzy techie divide at Stanford. There have been a lot of recent articles (here's <a href="https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=57728">one</a>) about the fact that fuzziness is being taken over by techniess. We can investigate this if we can come up with a way to describe what exactly is techie versus fuzzy.</p>
<p>The gut instinct solution is just to assing a number (negative for fuzzy, positive for techie) and then average over gender over time and see what's up, but I think that really doesn't help much since it's hard to know how techie some of the in between majors are (STS, HumBio/Psych, SymSys etc).</p>
<p>Majors are effectively made up of classes, so if we could somehow classify each class as being techie or fuzzy, we could then determine how techie/fuzzy the majors are and then average over the students. However, that requires a gut reaction for what the different classes' techie/fuzziness are.</p>
<p>So then how to solve that problem? Effectively, a class is made up of stuff you read and stuff you make/build/write (produce, in general, I guess). I'd be inclined to weight the stuff you product at at least a 3:1 ratio w.r.t. things you read since doing something teaches far more than reading about it. We could use the standard of avg hours of work for each assignment as a metric for how much each class does techie/fuzzy work.</p>
<p>Finally, it's hard to just think of the spectrum of techie and fuzzy. What does that mean, exactly? I think the acronym STEM can help break that down - the four major disciplies of techie are science, math, engineering, and technology. CS, for example, is pure tech and some math. Math is all math and some tech/science as a major. EE is evenly all of the above. MatSci is more science and engineering and less the other two etc etc. That's much easier to reason about than &quot;techniness&quot; or fuzziness. What might be harder is coming up with the appropriate opponent theory elements of humanities majors. What is the opposite of math? Art? Writing? Philosophy? It's hard to say... but I guess that's expected when you leave the techie world.</p>
<p>However, assuming we could come up with these 4 spectrums, the next question would be how to quantify them. I think that the best thing to do would be to use &quot;hours of work&quot; as a metric, then quantify each assignment in a class based on where it is in the scale (so hours = magnitude, and type = direction).</p>
<p>So in order to really do this calculation justice, I need data for the average hours spent on each assignment for each class at Stanford along with all the enrollment records for the majors (although I guess that could be approximated by looking at 4 year course plans).</p>
